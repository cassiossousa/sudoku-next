# Sudoku Next

A sophisticated Sudoku web application built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring advanced solving algorithms and a clean, interactive interface.

## Overview

This project implements a fully-featured Sudoku game with two powerful solving algorithms:

- **Single-Guess Solver**: Efficiently solves puzzles by filling cells with only one possible value
- **Backtracking Solver**: A comprehensive brute-force algorithm that can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle, including those with multiple solutions

The application demonstrates advanced TypeScript patterns, algorithmic thinking, and modern React development practices.

## Features

- **Interactive Sudoku Board**: 9x9 grid with proper 3x3 box segmentation
- **Dual Solving Algorithms**:
  - Fast single-guess solving for easy puzzles
  - Complete backtracking algorithm for complex puzzles
- **Type-Safe Architecture**: Full TypeScript implementation with interfaces and classes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Jest test suite covering core functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Clean UI with Tailwind CSS styling
- **Solver Step Tracking**: Detailed logging of solving process

## Tech Stack

### Core Framework

- **Next.js 16.2.1** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19.2.3** - UI library
- **TypeScript 5** - Type-safe JavaScript

### Styling & UI

- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Geist Fonts** - Modern typography from Vercel

### Development & Testing

- **Jest 30.2.0** - Testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing utilities
- **ESLint 9** - Code linting and formatting
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Sudoku Engine (`app/sudoku/`)

- `SudokuGridCell`: Individual cell implementation with value management
- `SudokuGrid`: Main grid class with validation and solving capabilities
- Interfaces for type safety: `IGridCell`, `IGrid`

#### Solving Algorithms (`app/solver/`)

- `single-guess.tsx`: Optimized solver for cells with single possible values
- `backtracking.tsx`: Comprehensive recursive backtracking algorithm
- `step.tsx`: Step tracking for solver visualization
- Comprehensive test suites for both algorithms

#### UI Components (`app/components/`)

- `sudoku-game.tsx`: Main game component with grid rendering
- `sudoku-game-cell.tsx`: Interactive cell component
- `sudoku-game-cell-initial.tsx`: Read-only component for initial values

### Algorithm Details

#### Single-Guess Solver

- Iteratively fills cells with only one possible value
- Optimizes other solving algorithms by reducing complexity
- Returns solving steps for tracking

#### Backtracking Solver

- Recursive brute-force approach with optimizations
- Handles puzzles with multiple solutions
- Complexity: O(exp(N)) where N is the number of empty cells
- Includes detailed documentation on algorithmic approach

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch
```

Test suites cover:

- Sudoku grid functionality
- Single-guess solver algorithm
- Backtracking solver algorithm
- Edge cases and error handling

## Algorithm Performance

- **Easy puzzles** (single-guess solvable): < 1 second
- **Medium puzzles**: Few seconds with backtracking
- **Hard puzzles** (17 clues, single solution): Few minutes
- **Very complex puzzles**: May take hours or more (multiple solutions)
